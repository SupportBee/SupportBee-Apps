TeamworkPM is an online project management software application that helps teams work together more productively online. Designed to help users manage their day to day projects either in a company or personal setting.

## Send a Ticket to Teamwork as a Task List or a Task in an Existing List

If you are using Teamwork for project management and often create tasks based on emails that your customers or clients send you, you can use our Teamwork app to accomplish this in one click! You can choose to create a new task list in Teamwork or add a new task in an existing task list which can be optionally assigned to a person in the project. We fill in the description of the task list/task with the contents of the email and also add a link to the SupportBee ticket so your team can follow-up once the task is completed. A link to the Teamwork item is also posted on the ticket as a comment.

## Support for Multiple Projects

Our app lets you pick a project and a task list before sending a ticket over to Teamwork.

## Adding the Teamwork App

To add the app, click on the 'Add to My SupportBee'. There is only one field to fill and you are ready to use tha app!

### API Token

Your API token can be found by logging into your Teamwork account, clicking your avatar in the top right and choosing Edit my details. On the API tab of the dialog click the 'Show your token' at the bottom (under 'API Authentication tokens').

## Using the App

To send a ticket to Teamwork, open a ticket and click Apps > Send to Teamwork. Before you send the ticket, you can edit the title/description. You can also select a project and an optional task list before sending the ticket over to Teamwork. In case you select an optional task list you can create a new task for that list and assign that to a person in the project. Once the ticket has been sent to Teamwork, a comment will with the URL of the task will be posted on the ticket automatically.
