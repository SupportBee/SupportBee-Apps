'Be less busy.' Slack brings all your communication together in one place. Add Slack to your SupportBee to get notifications for important events in your support desk. This app will notify you when a customer sends a new ticket or replies to an existing ticket, or when an agent answers a ticket or adds a comment on it. Sign up for Slack [here](https://slack.com/), its free!

To add the app, click **Add to My SupportBee** 

This app would send all your SupportBee notifications to Slack. The notifications would pop up in your Slack chat room, as a message from SupportBee. It would contain all the information of the ticket.

## Setting up Slack

  ### Webhook URL

- You would first need to add an **Incoming Webhook** to your Slack app. You can add a webhook in **Configure Integrations** in Slack.

- Once you setup an Incoming Webhook, Slack would provide you with a **unique Webhook URL**, add this to your SupportBee.

That's it, your done! You should be all set to see notifications pop up in your Slack app.

You can add a comment below for any queries related to this app, or write to us at support@supportbee.com."
