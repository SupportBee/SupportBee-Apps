### Setting up Slack

- To set-up Slack on your SupportBee, you would first need to add a webhook to your Slack account. You can add a webhook in **Configure Integrations** settings in your account.

- **Token**: This would be generated by Slack once you add a Webook integration, in the Configure Integrations page.

- **Channel Name**: You can add any Channel that is there in your Slack app. Say, you have a **#dev** channel, just add **dev** to the textbox. All the notifications in your SupportBee would pop up in this channel.

- **Publisher Name**: This would be the name of the organization you signed up with.

* **Company Name in Domain**: This is the name of your organization in the slack domain. Say, https://example.slack.com/ is your domain, **example** is what you need to enter the textbox.


That's it, your done! You are now all set to see notifications pop up in your Slack app.
